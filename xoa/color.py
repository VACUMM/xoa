    vmin: float

    Parameters
    ----------
    cmap:
        The colormap to adapt
    specs: str, None
        Transformation specifications or None.
        When a string, it must have the format "<type><value>", where
        type is "piv" or "cyc", and value is convertible to a float.
        If "piv", that colormap expects typically diverging, and cropped
        using :func:`crop_cmap`, after min and max value are set with
        :meth:`set_vlim`.
        If "cyc", min is set to 0 and max to "value", and the colormap is
        expected to be circular, like "cmo.phase".

    Example
    -------
    >>> cma = CmapAdapter('cmo.balance', 'piv0')
    >>> cma.set_vlim(data.min(), data.max())
    >>> plt.pcolormesh(xx, yy, data, **cma.get_dict())
