    """Regrid along a single dimension

    The input and output coordinates may vary along other dimensions,
    which useful for instance for vertical interpolation in coastal
    ocean models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    da: xarray.DataArray
        Array to interpolate
    coord: xarray.DataArray
        Output coordinate
    method: str, int
        Regridding method as one of the following:
        {regrid1d_methods.rst_with_links}
    dim:  str, tuple(str), None
        Dimension on which to operate. If a string, it is expected to
        be the same dimension for both input and output coordinates.
        Else, provide a two-element tuple: ``(dim_coord_in, dim_coord_out)``.
    coord_in_name: str, None
        Name of the input coordinate array, which must be known of ``da``
    conserv: bool
        Use conservative regridding when using ``cellave`` method.
    extrap: str, int
        Extrapolation mode as one of the following:
        {extrap_modes.rst_with_links}

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Regridded array with ``coord`` as new coordinate array.
